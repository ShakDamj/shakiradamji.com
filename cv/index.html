Citizens Advice is a national charity that works with a network of local offices in around 2500 locations across the country to give people a way forwards with their problems. Trained advisors help with issues such as housing, debt and benefits. 

<h2>2020 Casebook - Senior Product Designer </h2>

Casebook is a case management system for centrally storing Citizens Advice client data.

The role required designing and prototyping complex user journeys, form design, working with GDPR and knowledge of front and back-end technologies. The nature of the system meant working closely with advisers and learning how local offices work. Wider strategic work such as influencing the product roadmap and writing business proposals.

Designed the new SMS appointment reminder feature (shown to reduce no shows by 3%), streamlined the calendars and booking system, redesigned the client registration form; which led to a successful proposal for a focused project to address issues around how we collect consent and special category data.

Played a key role in embedding accessibility within the team. Introduced new a11y focused ways of working such as assistive tech labs, a11y acceptance criteria and a11y testing. This has resulted in prioritising accessibility in the roadmap, a suite of design changes and new components that meet WCAG compliance.

Continued to be an integral part of the Design System working group. Recent work includes helping to design the contribution model and raising the profile of the design system using presentations and workshops.

<h2> 2019 Design System Team - Mid-weight UX Designer </h2>

Developing an accessible design system for Citizens Advice 3 main websites. 

Worked in a fully agile, multidisciplinary team to rebuild and migrate the public and adviser facing websites. 

Played a key role in conducting an accessibility audit of the public website. Findings were used to develop a design system that will improve the accessibility of around 2000 advice articles. The site has also seen an improved load time of 37% for migrated content.

Used A/B testing and analytics to make improvements to components. Worked towards increasing consistency across Citizens Advice products. Oversaw front-end implementation to ensure components met AA requirements on WCAG 2.1.

Created responsive designs in Figma that harnessed the power of global libraries and reusable components.

Worked with advisers to understand pain points with search. Findings lead to a content and weighting strategy that improved results.
