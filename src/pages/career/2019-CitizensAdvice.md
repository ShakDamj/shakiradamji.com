National charity that works with a network of local offices in around 2500 locations nationwide to give people a way forwards. Trained advisors help with issues such as debt and benefits. 

Worked in a fully agile, multidisciplinary team to rebuild and migrate the public and adviser facing websites. 

Played a key role in conducting an accessibility audit of the public website. Findings were used to develop a design system that will improve the accessibility of around 2000 advice articles. The site has also seen an improved load time of 37% for migrated content.

Used A/B testing and analytics to make improvements to components. Worked towards increasing consistency across Citizens Advice products. Oversaw front-end implementation to ensure components met AA requirements on WCAG 2.1.

Created responsive designs in Figma that harnessed the power of global libraries and reusable components.

Worked with advisers to understand pain points with search. Findings lead to a content and weighting strategy that improved results.
