Small creative agency with a variety of projects and clients. 

Worked with Camden CCG to rethink the way GPs find services in their borough. Worked with the client to create a new process that allowed commissioners to more easily upload services. Tested new designs with commissioners and led meetings with in-house development team to ensure features were achievable within constraints.

Worked with Bruton Lloyd designing a new CRM system for their tutors. Facilitated client workshops to understand requirements and advised on timeframes. Planned and ran interviews, drawing insights to ensure the product was user-centred. Designed and tested responsive, interactive wireframes for the 3 parts of the system: tutor, client and agency.

Created an internship role in the design team and managed the development of the intern.
