The Shed Collective are a small creative agency with a variety of projects and clients. While at Shed I worked on a variety of different projects inclusing on websites, internal systems and marketplace apps. Clients they work with include NHS Camden CCG, Bruton Lloyd and Egon Zhender. 

Projects: 
Worked with Camden CCG to rethink the way GPs find services in their borough. Worked with the client to create a new process that allowed commissioners to more easily upload services. Tested new designs with commissioners and led meetings with in-house development team to ensure features were achievable within constraints.

Worked with Bruton Lloyd designing an internal bookings, file sharing and invoicing system for tutors and pupils. Facilitated client workshops to understand requirements and advised on timeframes. Planned and ran interviews, drawing insights to ensure the product was user-centred. Designed and tested responsive, interactive wireframes for the 3 parts of the system: tutor, client and agency.

Advocated for an internship role in the design team and managed the hiring and development of the intern.
