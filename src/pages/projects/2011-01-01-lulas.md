### Version 1

A simulation of cells hunting each other. There are three kind of cells: Plants (dark green), Herbivores (light green) and Hunters (red).

Demo unavailable :(

### Version 2

Starting from scratch in order to simplify implementation of more complex behavior like "flocking behavior". This is the behaviour birds and fish show when they are in group. They align their direction of movement with their parners, staying close to them while avoiding collision.

This project was paused while looking for a good [Quadtree][1] implementation to improve performance.

You can see the test suite running at start in the browser's developer tool, this same suite of tests also runs on Jest in Github Actions.
