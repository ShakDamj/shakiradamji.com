### Introduction

The team didn’t have a designer or a researcher before we joined so we worked with them to test and improve the user journeys and the design. There’s a lot to be considered because many different areas of the system are affected. Our work ensured that advisers have a simple and cohesive journey. Launched to early adopters in March the text message reminder system has already been shown to reduce no shows by 3%.

### Overview and aims
The main goal of the text messaging system is to reduce missed appointments by 6%. It’s can also be used to remind clients about any important information or documents they need to bring to their appointment which should save time and reduce the need to book followups.

Benefits for our local offices
By using Gov Notify under the hood we aim to provide our local offices with one of the most competitive prices for SMS systems on the market (only 1.6 pence + VAT for each message). Local offices should spend less time importing client data into third-party providers and manually sending messages from office phones. We’ve also addressed GDPR and security concerns by fully integrating the functionality.


### Process
Advisers who weren’t familiar with the Casebook calendars system struggled to set up automatic reminders in the original design. They found it difficult to make the mental connection between creating the text message template and then navigating to the calendar setup section, turning the reminders on and linking the template. Only 2/7 users managed to complete this task successfully.

On the second iteration, I introduced an information alert that shows for any templates that aren’t attached to a calendar. When we retested the journey 7/7 users were successful and 6/7 used the link in the alert.


### Outcomes

Initial data has shown a reduction of 3% for no shows.
